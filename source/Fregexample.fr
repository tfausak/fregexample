module Fregexample where

{--
    Compute the next term in the Collatz sequence for the given number.

    I want this type signature to be:

        collatz :: (Integral a) => a -> a

    But I can't call it from Clojure if I do that. I get this error:

        No matching method: collatz
-}
collatz :: Long -> Long
collatz n
    | n <= 1 = n
    | otherwise = case n `quotRem` 2 of
        (q, 0) -> q
        (_, _) -> n * 3 + 1
